# js_color_flipper
A simple application built with javascript, it simply generates colors from (rgb) or a random color from (rgb)

Why I did this project?
After being inconsistent for a while, I have the opportunity to back to coding and im a bif to grow my knowlwdge of javascript
, I chose this and a few other projects which I would push as soon as I finished them. 

What I learned/relearned from this project 

* How to select  html elements by class using: 
- querySelector();
- getElementById();
- Adding event listeners to selected elements.
- Callback functions in the event listeners.

Please feel free to use this project as you wish and improve.
